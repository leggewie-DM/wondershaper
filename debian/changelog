wondershaper (1.1a-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ${misc:Depends} to control
    This fixes lintian debhelper-but-no-misc-depends.
  * Upgraded dh compat from 4 to 8.  Updated control and compat to match.
    This fixes lintian package-uses-deprecated-debhelper-compat-version
  * Upgrade standards version from 3.8.0 to 3.9.1.0
    This fixes lintian out-of-date-standards-version
  * Fix copyright file.
    This fixes lintian copyright-without-copyright-notice
  * Changed from dh_clean -k to dh_prep
    This fixes lintian dh-clean-k-is-deprecated
  * The wondershaper command has been relocated from /usr/sbin to /sbin,
    in order to comply with Debian Policy. Please update any scripts you
    might have pointing to the old location.
    Policy considerations:
    As a boot time network interface command, it belongs in the same
    place as /sbin/tc, iptables, etc.
    From a dependency standpoint, its intended to be run from
    /etc/network/interfaces at boot time, so cannot be in a directory
    that is theoretically NFS mountable.
  * Mentined RTNETLINK errors resulting from CONFIG_NET_ACT_POLICE
    misoptioning in the Debian README file.
    (Closes: #395971)
  * Use full path when calling tc
    (Closes: #504583)
  * Added some commentary to the Debian README explaining how to
    optionally optimize the results.
    (Closes: #592579)
